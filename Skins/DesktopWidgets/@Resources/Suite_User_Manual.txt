--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|| Introduction

DesktopWidgets Suite is a Rainmeter skin suite designed to add more functionality to the 
plain old desktop.

Be sure to check on the deviant art page every now and then, for any updates to the skin. 
To update but keep your current layout; simply install the new package, but select the 
option to not install the new layout.
To play safe, you can first make a backup of your layout by saving it under another name.

This manual will be actively updated as time goes.

If you need to quickly find info in this manual, press "Ctrl" and "f" at the same 
time while in this manual, then type a keyword and press enter.
(You have to place the cursor at the top of this document to searc h the whole thing)

This whole skin is copyright free. Take whatever you want, as long as you give credit :)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|| Modifications/Further customisation/Tooltips

This skin suite uses a stylesheet for formatting options which are used multiple
times throughtout the suite. If you need to change formatting options such as 
font size, font type, text colour, line thickness, line colours, etc, you can edit 
the stylesheet once, refresh rainmeter, and have the changes propagate throughout 
every skin in the entire suite. 
Note: not everything is changeable through the stylesheet. 

The style sheet is called BVstylesheet.inc.
It is located in the @resources folder.

You can turn tooltips on and off by going to the BVsettings.inc file stored
in the @resources folder
turn OFF tooltips: ToolTipHidden=1
turn ON tooltips:  ToolTipHidden=0


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|| Skins Details

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------BBC NEWS

Shows world news from the BBC site, right on your desktop

The skin parses a maximum of 24 headlines from the RSS feed. How ever it only shows 15 in order 
to fit on a standard 1080p display setup along with all other surrounding skins. If you want 
more headlines to show, go into the .ini file, and for each extra headline, change the property 
hidden=1 to hidden=0 for its meter section. 
(The extra sections are already there, they are simply set to be hidden).

String index sections and meter sections were very long and repetitive with an obvious 
pattern. They were thus easily generated using a simple looping c++ program. The source 
code can be found in the @resources folder in the sub folder named RSSparsetools. You can 
edit, recompile the code, run it, and then copy-paste the sections from the auto-generated text 
file to replace the existing sections in the .ini file to customise the meters however you want. 
Of course you could edit the sections manually too, but it would take quite a while.

There is an OPEN button that opens up the BBC page in your browser.
Each individual headline can also be clicked to open up its corresponding news article in your 
default browser.

Another button instantly refreshes the skin.

It auto refreshes every 10 minutes.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CPU

Shows history of CPU activity characteristics.

Additional information will appear when you hover your cursor over it. 
Other wise, measures are disabled and meters hidden.

The speed meter shows the maximum clock speed of the CPU.

The peak use meter shows the highest recorded usage since the last refresh.

The avg usage meter shows the mean of the last 20 values of the 
cpu usage.

The use meter shows real time measurements of the cpu usage.

The graph and network measures updates once a second. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FOUNTAIN OF COLORS

The Fountain of Colors skin is an audio spectrum analyser for your desktop. 
It provides a visual interpretation of all the audio your computer is outputting.
Each of the 152 bars represents the overall amplitude (loudness) of a small 
range of frequencies.

The entire frequency range of this spectrum analyser is 20-18000Hz
(a bit more than the frequency hearing range of the average adult).
 
This range is distributed across bars in a logarithmic scale, that is, 
each bar is not necessarily representing a 118Hz range.
Reason is simply to match with our own logarithmic perception of sound frequency.

The bars change colour randomly, with the higher peaking bars having a noticeably 
different colour tone from the other bars.

When there is no audio, the bars disappear leaving only the baseline.

Read FOUNTAIN OF COLORS CONTROLS for instructions on positioning this skin.


Issues:
If you find that all your sounds are producing really short bars or even 
not appearing, you can:

-Increase your media player's volume

OR

-Right click the visualiser skin
-Click edit variables
-Look for a line that says:
 sensitivity=...
-Change the number to something a bit higher


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FOUNTAIN OF COLORS CONTROLS

Simple, quick access control interface for media playback

Includes meters that display the track title, current time position 
and duration.

On the far right is a clickable segmented volume controller bar. Each segment gives 
a 5 percent change in volume.

In the middle are a set of features for media playback control. On the left is a
meter showing timeposition/Duration of the currently playing media.
The buttons from left to right are:
previous, pause, play, next, open media player's window.


On the far left is a toggle button for cycling through your system's output devices.
When you click it, audio will be routed to the next available device.
NOTE: Changing devices stops the Fountain of Colors spectrum analyser from 
picking up audio, since it is set to only analyse audio outputting to the default 
audio device.

Default audio device in Windows can be changed by using "Manage Audio Devices" 
from the Windows Start menu.


Default media player:
The controls work with Windows Media Player by default. 
To change the media player,
-Go to the .ini file
-Near the top you should see:
   [MeasureNowPlayingTrack]

-Look for the line that says:
   PlayerName=...

-Change ... to a compatible player you use. 
-This link gives more information on accepted players.
 http://docs.rainmeter.net/manual/plugins/nowplaying


Details on positioning and dynamic size:
-Notice that when there is no media playing in WMP, the song title disappears and
 the skin shrinks, then expands again to accomodate the title when a new song starts 
 playing. As well as changing size, it also changes the absolute position of the 
 FOUNTAIN OF COLORS analyser on the desktop.

-Thus, this Fountain of Colors Controls skin (media controller) determines where the 
 Fountain of Colors skin (spectrum analyser) will appear. 
 The analyser will ALWAYS appear above the media controller. 
 To position both, you have to move the media controller to the required location, 
 then refresh rainmeter. 
 The analyser will automatically appear on top.


Issues:

1)
There was a bug where the nowplaying measure sometimes did not update properly.
If a song was playing in Windows Media Player, which was then closed, the 
measure would correctly clear out, and the title and position/duration meters
would correctly disappear. 

However, upon opening another song, there was about 
a 50% chance the meters and measures would not update, remaining blank. When 
refreshed, then it showed up normally. I have not tested the skin with other 
media players, so I don't if the problem is windows media player, my computer 
only or the plugin.

I have come up with a workaround for this bug. A separate invisible skin called 
"glitchworkaround" (in the Fountain of Colors Controls folder) measures whether 
the WMP process is running. If it is, it will refresh the "Fountain of Colors 
Controls" once. 

If your player is not WMP and you also have this problem have this 
problem, you have to go into the glitch workaround skin and change to the correct 
media player's process name.

To get the name of the process: 
-launch the player
-right click the taskbar
-click Start Task Manager
-click the Processes tab
-Now look for the process's name (it should look similar to the proper name)

2)
After clicking the toggle button for changing output device, sound may sometimes
no longer work. This can usually be fixed by refreshing Rainmeter.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------GOOGLE SEARCH BAR 

Google search right from your desktop!

Usage Instructions:
-Click the bar anywhere
-Type your query
-Press ENTER on the keyboard.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------HDD

Shows history of HDD activity characteristics and also the name of your drive

R+W stands for Read + Write. It is the total of the values for Read and Write.

Avg is short for average.
The avg meters all show the mean of the last 30 values of their respective measures.

Additional information will appear when you hover your cursor over it. 
Other wise, measures are disabled and meters hidden.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------INPUT NOTES BETTER

Write notes and reminders for youself!

You have to load this skin yourself.
This skin is harder to use than the Windows sticky notes, so I don't even use it.

There are multiple copies of this same skin to allow multiple loaded notes.

The bottom line will move allowing the whole skin to grow/shrink and accomodate 
more/less text. It will stop expanding around 3/4 of the screen height

Instructions for using
- Click the OPEN button to open Notepad
- Type your message as you would naturally
- You can use ENTER for a new line
- SAVE and CLOSE the file
- Click the REFRESH button on this skin


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------INTERNET RADIO LIST/INTERNET RADIO STREAM SERVICES

This skin opens a list of radio streaming services. When you click on one, it 
will open up the stream in Windows Media Player (as long as you have designated 
windows media player to open .m3u files. This is already the Windows default setting 
unless you have changed it).

Some of these streams won't start playing until you click the position/navigation 
bar on the windows Media Player window.
Possibly having a common cause, the same streams also will not respond when the 
play/pause button is clicked, while others normally would.
Some streams will stutter a bit at the beginning when started. This always goes 
away for me after about a minute.

Instructions for adding more stations:
-To add your own stream channels, you have to find the source for them. This is not 
 always easy. Good news is this Wikipedia page told me everything I needed to know.
     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U
 Have a read, and if you are still lost, feel free to ask me through Deviant Art.
 Sometimes, a radio channel's website will allow you to download the .m3u file 
 directly.
 Mostly I had to dig into the site's source code and use guess and check to find
 the stream link, then copy-paste the link into my own .m3u file.
 
-When you have the .m3u file, go to,
 Documents > Rainmeter > Skins > DesktopWidgets > @Resources > RadioStreams
 and drop the m3u file there.

-Open the .ini file of the RadioList skin, scroll to the very end and simply copy-paste 
 the entire [BUTTONstream13], [OPENSite13] and [Stream13] sections to duplicate them. 

-Rename the sections to whatever you want. eg. [BUTTONstream14], [OPENSite14] and [Stream14]
 All this does is make the names different so Rainmeter can do its thing properly.
 
-There should be a piece of the code you just copied that looks like this 
 ["#@#RadioStreams\ANYFILENAME.m3u"]
 Replace 'ANYFILENAME' with the name of your .m3u file.
 
-Another piece of code looks like this 
 ["#eVIEWER#" "http://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/"]
 Replace the existing link with a link to the webpage of your new radio stream.
 This link simply gives you a convenient way to quickly access the site. It does 
 not affect the streaming operation in any way.

-Now you have to expand the skin to fit that extra list option you just inserted.
 Scroll to the top, look for [variables]
 Then look for, 'maxheight=number'
 Add 20 (for each line you added) to what ever the number is and replace it.

-Now save the .ini file and refresh the whole suite.

Issues:
If the skin is appearing without background, or underneath other skins:
-Right click
-Click manage skin
-Change load order to a larger number. eg 10. If problem persists, 
 try a larger number. The skin with the highest load order appears on top.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MAINTENANCE TOOLS

A skin that provides a quick access menu for some usually further to reach 
but very handy windows administrations functions.

This skin requires your system locality short string to allow the 
Windows Update button to work. It reads a windows registry entry, obtains a hex code
then using a 'table' it translates the code into its associated string. With
about 128 languages supported, most people should be fine.

Issues:
1)
If clicking the Windows Update does not bring you to the update window, your 
language is not included in the table. You can quickly add your own system locality.
 -First find your system locality short string (for example: en-au, en-us, 
  it-it, ja, ko etc)
 -Open the Maintenance Tools .ini file, scroll all the way down to the section
  [windupdate]
 -Look for the line starting with 
  leftmouseupaction=....
 -On that line, you will find 
  [TranslateSystLangCode]
 -Replace it with your system locality short string. It should end up like this
  ...\Indexed\Settings\en-us\AAA_SystemSettings_MusUpdate...

2)
If the skin is appearing without background, or underneath other skins:
-right click
-click manage skin
-change load order to a larger number. eg 10. if problem persists, 
 try a larger number. The skin with the highest load order appears on top.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------NETWORK INFORMATION

Shows addressing and network related information about your system.

There is a button that opens up the Windows Network and Sharing Center.

Another button instantly refreshes the skin.

The skin will automatically select the network adaptor that is currently 
active.

It includes a functioning measure that tests whether your LAN and WAN 
connection are online or offline.

The ping measure updates every 5 seconds and displays average of last 5 
readings for a more likely representation of your ping. Rainmeter only 
sends one ping packet and waits for it to return. Of course any thing can 
happen to this single packet during its journey through the vast entirety 
of the internet, making it unreliable. Thus, other ping tests send 
multiple packets at once and takes the average result. Rainmeter can not 
send  multiple packets, so an average over a few seconds will have to do. 

The rest of the skin refreshes as below:
   -1 (once): host, user, os name, os bits
              since any changes to these properties require a restart 
              or refresh of the computer to register
   1 seconds: wan status, lan status
  30 seconds: wan ip, lan ip, mask, gateway, dns, adaptor
   5 seconds: ping


The regular spikes with 30 second gaps that you see in the network traffic 
skins are caused by this network info skin updating its WAN IP meter.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------NETWORK DOWNLOAD/UPLOAD

Both shows stats on the network traffic in the their respective streams.

Clicking either one of the refresh buttons will clear the network statistics 
for both network traffic skins.
The last date the buttons were clicked is recorded and displayed in the 
Last Reset meter.

The total Up/Dl meter shows total data accumulated from upload/download traffic
since the last refresh.

The peak Up/Dl meter shows the highest recorded upload/download speed since 
the last refresh.

The average Up/Dl meter shows the average of the last 30 values of the 
upload/download speed.

The current Up/Dl shows real time measurements of upload/download speed.

The graph and network measures update once a second. Rainmeter's method of 
getting/calculating the network stats requires the 1 measure per second rate, 
as otherwise the value we get will be inaccurate.

The regular spikes with 30 second gaps that you see in the network download skin 
are caused by the network info skin updating its WAN IP meter. The data downloaded 
is very small, and only the graph's auto scaling function causes the spikes to look 
large.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------RAM

Shows history of RAM usage characteristics

The peak meter shows the highest recorded usage since the last refresh.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------REMOVABLE/PORTABLE DRIVES

These skins are slightly smaller than the HDD skins and are meant for use with portable drives.

They each have an OPEN button that opens the root directory of their target 
drive.


They each have an eject button that safely ejects the drive. If if ejecting fails, a 
a notification appears warning you so.

The programs I used for the drive ejection function are:
nircmd for ejecting optical discs
- http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/create-a-shortcut-or-hotkey-to-eject-the-cddvd-drive/
- http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html
USB_Disk_Eject for ejecting USB drives
- http://jsmorley.deviantart.com/art/USBDrive-273453859


They hide by default, with all their measures disabled, and only reactivate 
when the drive is plugged in again.

All the Removeable Drives Skins are linked together by their positions. They
will all appear below the first skin for drive (F:). Thus, when you want to 
position the skins, just move the (F:) skin to where you want, then refresh
rainmeter and the other loaded Removeable Drives skins will position themselves 
below.
Each skin references the skin immediately below it, and moves them up or down 
depending on whether it is hidden or invisible.

The skins are in alphabetical order.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------RM GLOBAL CONTROLS

Controls all other skins in the DesktopWidgets suite. It is not meant to affect itself,
unless Refresh All or Activate All button is clicked. Clicking 
either of those 2 buttons will cause the skin to close due it being 
refreshed/reactivated.


It replaces many of the Rainmeter notification menu items.
On my dual monitor setup, it is located right above my start button.
For most people it should also appear above their start button.

Edge Snap and draggable options are truly toggle functions. 
e.g. if half your skins are draggable and half are not, then clicking
Draggable Toggle All will not lock them all in place (or unlock).
Therefore, you should leave all of your skins on draggable and then click
Draggable Toggle All to lock them. click again when you want to unlock them all.

Make sure you have set the DISABLE DRAGGABLE option to off in the 
manage rainmeter > settings window.

For ACTIVATE ALL to work, you must name a layout (with all the skins 
you need, including MasterSwitch and invisible skins such as StartUpSound 
and the glitchworkaround skin) as "mylayout".

This skin hides by default and appears when you hover over it.

Issues:
If the skin is appearing without background, or underneath other skins:
-Right click
-Click manage skin
-Change load order to a larger number. eg 10. If problem persists, 
 try a larger number. The skin with the highest load order appears on top.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------StartUpSound

This invisible skin plays sounds for 2 events: 
 1) When Rainmeter is refreshed 
    (including when your computer boots up to the destop or when you manually
    refresh Rainmeter)
 2) When you deactivate your layout. 
    (thus, you need to include this skin in your layout if you want the 
    deactivation sound)

By default, a refresh plays the Windows cityscape logon sound, while a 
deactivation plays the Windows cityscape theme logoff sound.

To change the sound effect played:
 -Save your sound in .wav format (if it isn't already)
 -Drop the file into the @Resources folder
 -Open the StartUpSound .ini file
 -Look for the lines
  OnRefreshAction=[Play "#@#LogonSoundCityscape.wav"]
  OnCloseAction=[Play "#@#LogoffSoundCityscape.wav"]
 -replace LogonSoundCityscape or LogoffSoundCityscape 
  with the name of your .wav file

This skin is also affected by the RM Global Controls skin.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SWAP

Shows history of SWAP usage characteristics. Your SWAP file is also known as 
virtual RAM or a paging file. It is space on your harddrive that is allocated 
to 'extending' the capacity of your physical RAM.

The peak meter shows the highest recorded usage since the last refresh.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TIMEWEATHER

A time, date and weather widget. Uses The Weather Channel RSS feed to get data.

There is a button that opens up "The Weather Channel" website to display
more information about weather in your location.

Another button instantly refreshes the skin.

It auto refreshes every 10 minutes.

You have to go into the code yourself to change your location code and 
unit measurement if you need.


To change location:
1) Go to https://weather.com
2) The website should automatically use your current location, if it does not, then find it using the search
3) Look at the URL address bar. You should see something like 
   https://weather.com/en-AU/weather/today/l/xxxxxxxx:1:AS
   The 8-letter code xxxxxxxx should be your weather location code.


To change units of measurements:
Units of measurement: m for metric   (celcius, km)
		      f for imperial (fahrenheit, miles)


Date and time are based on your system clock.

Location is determined from the location code you entered.

Temperature is in the format: current [low - high]

Suncycle shows the sunrise and sunset times

Condition is a qualitative description of the current weather (not a forecast).

Wind Velocity, Humidity and Air Pressure are all current data (not a forecast).

Chance of rain is split into daytime and nighttime chance. (forecasted data)

Of course, since the skin refreshes only every 10 minutes, "current" data are not accurate to the second. 
However, you will find that the RSS feed itself only updates every few minutes anyway.


Issues:
Some locations seem to not have all the information (these meters will show "updating..."). 
Nothing can be done at this point except use a more famous nearby location.
